		The floating islands of PieceFall were once the site of ancient spiritual monuments dedicated to tranquillity. Since then, the islands have fallen out of balance, and you must rebuild the land piece by piece to restore the monuments. PieceFall is a geometric puzzle game, set in an abstract floating world. Complete puzzles to build structures and enhance your surroundings. Unlock bonuses, earn stars, and maximise your score! Are you ready to accept the challenge, and restore harmony to the islands?

			<description>We’ve worked very closely with the Steel Minions studio to help them bring this game to market. The benefits of studying on an industry-accredited course are made obvious by the skills and talents of these students. In recent years, as indie gaming has exploded, PlayStation First has worked hard to narrow the gap between student teams and indie studios. PieceFall is a true testament to our investment.</description>
